# Loss pots

There are 3 types of loss pots that accumulate losses by types.
Loss pots can later offset the taxable base by deducting the accumulated losses.

| Loss Pot Name             | Covered Assets                 | Offset Against (Gains)                            |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| **Aktienverlusttopf**     | Individual stocks only.        | **Only** gains from individual stocks.            |
| **Sonstiger Verlusttopf** | ETFs, funds, bonds, etc.       | **Any** capital income (ETFs, dividends, stocks). |
| **Quellensteuertopf**     | Foreign taxes paid (e.g., US). | Reduces the German tax liability.                 |

:exclamation: Main rule: What a loss pot can offset depends on its type and the income category.

Loss pots are automatically transferred to the new fiscal year if not fully utilized (except **Quellensteuertopf**).
