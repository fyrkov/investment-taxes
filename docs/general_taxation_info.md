# General info about taxes on investments

Investment income in Germany is taxed with:

| Tax Component                                         | Rate       | Description                                                  |
|:------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Abgeltungsteuer, Capital Gains Tax**                | 25%        | Base rate for dividends, interest, and asset sales.          |
| **Solidaritätszuschlag (Soli), Solidarity Surcharge** | +5.5%      | Calculated on the tax amount (effectively 1.375% of profit). |
| **Kirchensteuer, Church Tax**                         | +8% or +9% | Optional (depending on your registered church status).       |

Normally, the effective total rate without church tax is 26.375%.

In most cases, taxation is applied immediately upon the realization of capital gains.
This means that each taxable event is taxed without delay.
One exception is VOPA.

### FIFO principle:
Capital gains are calculated using the FIFO principle:
the sale value minus the original buy value(s) of the oldest shares position(s) in chronological order.

#### Example:

Buy transactions

| Lot  | Quantity | Buy price | Cost basis |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Buy1 | 10       | 100       | 1 000      |
| Buy2 | 10       | 120       | 1 200      |
| Buy3 | 10       | 140       | 1 400      |

Sell transactions

| Sell  | Quantity | Sell price | Proceeds |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| Sell1 | 15       | 150        | 2 250    |

FIFO matching and profit

| Sell  | Matched buy | Quantity | Profit per unit | Profit |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Sell1 | Buy1        | 10       | 150 − 100 = 50  | 500    |
| Sell1 | Buy2        | 5        | 150 − 120 = 30  | 150    |

**Total taxable profit:** 650

Remaining open lots

| Lot  | Remaining qty | Buy price |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Buy2 | 5             | 120       |
| Buy3 | 10            | 140       |
