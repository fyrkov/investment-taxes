# Teilfreistellung (Partial Exemption)

Some funds have a partial exemption.\
For example, Finanzamt allows to tax only 70% of gains on equity ETFs.\
This also applies to VOPA.\
This also applies to loss pots, e.g. only 70% of losses can be recorded to the loss pot.

| Asset Type        | Requirement  | Taxable Portion |

| **Equity ETF**    | > 51% Stocks | **70%**         |
| **Mixed ETF**     | > 25% Stocks | **85%**         |
| **Bond/Gold ETF** | < 25% Stocks | **100%**        |
