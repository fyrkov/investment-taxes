# Withholding tax

Withholding tax (WHT) refers to taxes withheld _at source_.\
It is mainly applied to dividends and similar income from foreign securities.

WHT is usually calculated and withheld by a custodian in the given jurisdiction for non-local securities.

:exclamation: If a double taxation treaty (DTT) exists between the source country and the investor’s country of tax residence, 
a reduced treaty rate may apply instead of the standard domestic rate.

WHT depends on:
1. instrument’s source country
3. investor’s tax residence
5. local tax law in the source country
7. applicable double taxation treaty (if any)
